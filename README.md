# folkmusicmap
A non-geographical map to travel through folk music

We explore similarity in a set of 2170 recordings (70 recordings from each of 31 countries). 
Recordings are described by a feature vector capturing rhythmic, melodic, harmonic and timbral aspects. 
Similarity is estimated via the Mahalanobis distance.

Using Mahalanobis distances we create three visualizations:

1) a 2D tSNE embedding (https://nazareno.github.io/folkmusicmap/graph/scatter.html)

2) a nearest neighbor network (https://nazareno.github.io/folkmusicmap/folks-network.html)

3) a nearest neighbor network plotted on a world map (https://nazareno.github.io/folkmusicmap/similarity_map)
